# StackUp-July-Coding-Challenge

## Improving StackUp Platform Experience

### Introduction

As a participant, I have come to appreciate the platform's engaging quests and rewards system. However, I've noticed some areas where the user experience and learning outcomes could significantly improve. Here are my thoughts on how to make StackUp even better

### Identified issues

1. **First-Come, First-Served Reward System**:  While it motivates us to participate quickly, it also means many of us rush through the quests without truly understanding or benefiting from the content. The recently introduced approach is better but I believe it can be further improved.

2. **Limited Guidance on Quests**: I found that most of the participants ignore the bounty tasks because they are not sure how to complete them. And also on some simple tasks such as Creating a writeup, coming up with ideas, and conducting research. They seem simple but for users like me find it challenging. For instance, I had to use chatGPT to come up with this writeup.

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Enhanced Quest Structure with Creative Challenges**: Instead of completing a quest and forgetting about it, what if optional creative challenges are offered at the end of the quest to encourage deeper understanding and application of the content? Also since most concepts are mostly new, it would be nice to have more resources/tutorials based on the quest topic that are project-based and encourage participants to solve real-world problems related to the quest content.

2. **Improved Content **: To address the issue of limited guidance, I suggest creating comprehensive content that covers basic tasks we often find challenging. This could include tutorials or guides with tips on structuring writeups, conducting research, brainstorming and presenting ideas effectively, and participating in a bounty task. This would help participants who are not familiar with the tasks to do their best without worrying much on how and where to start.
